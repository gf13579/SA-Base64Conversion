# SA-Base64Conversion

A small Splunk add-on to provide base64 conversion as a custom command.

Created because there were no supported base64 add-ons anymore on Splunkbase. Also as a reason to play with the [Universal Configuration Console](https://splunk.github.io/addonfactory-ucc-generator/).

Existing add-ons for base64 conversion include:
- [SA-base64](https://github.com/Kintyre/SA-base64)
- [TA-base64](https://github.com/cameronjust/TA-base64)
